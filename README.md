- Data Insertion: Inserted sample data across all tables for simulation.
- Analytical Queries: Generated reports on patient demographics, most common diagnoses, average billing per treatment, department-wise stats, and doctor-patient interactions.
- CRUD Operations: Performed create, read, update, and delete operations on various entities like patients, appointments, and medical records.
- Joins & Aggregation: Used complex joins and aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, AVG) for insights into healthcare operations.
